# Critical Evaluation

- **Compute dependence:** key scaling trends are shown at large step budgets; reproduction is compute-expensive.
- **Evaluation sensitivity:** FID depends on sampling protocol (steps/CFG/EMA). Protocol drift shifts results.
- **Matched-compute comparisons:** “equal compute” depends on compute definition; patch size changes can entangle effects.
